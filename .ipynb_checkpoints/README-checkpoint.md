Plot Sharpe Ratios
Investment managers and their institutional investors look at the return-to-risk ratio, not just the returns. (After all, if you have two portfolios that each offer a 10% return, yet one is lower risk, you would invest in the lower-risk portfolio, right?)
From the sharpe ratio bar graph we can see that not all algorithmic trading portfolios outperformed the S&P500. Algo 1 trading strategy not only outperformed the S&P500 but it also achieved a lower beta, tighter spreads, lower systematic risk, and a higher sharpe ratio. Algo 2 treading strategy failed to capture all of the S&P500 upside however, it was successful in lowering systematic risk and achieved tighter spreads. 
Create Custom Portfolio
Harold is ecstatic that you were able to help him prove that the algorithmic trading portfolios are doing so well compared to the market and whales portfolios. However, now you are wondering whether you can choose your own portfolio that performs just as well as the algorithmic portfolios. Investigate by doing the following:
My custom portfolio which consisted of evenly weighted allocations in Google, JPM, the Coca-Cola Company, Johnson and Johnson, CVS, and General Electric failed to outperform the S&P500. The spread was similar to that of the S&P500 as volatility when compared to that of the S&P was 0.139 and 0.135, respectively.  The sharpe ratio was 0.396 and 0.656, respectively.
